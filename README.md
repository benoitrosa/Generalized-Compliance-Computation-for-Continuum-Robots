## Description

**This code computes the Quasistatic Model, the Generalized Compliance Matrix and the Joint Jacobian of a continuum robot :**
- Concentric Tubes Continuum Robots (CTCR)
- Tendon Actuated Continuum Robot (TACR)
- Concentric Agonist-Antagonist Robot (CAAR) will be released soon

**The Generalized Compliance Matrix is a kind of Jacobian that fully captures the flexibility properties of the robot. It is a powerful mathematical tool for :**
- Trajectory planning algorithms that take into account mechanical contacts between the robot and its environment
- For stiffness modulation algorithms
- Vision-based contact force estimation algorithms

**An example is provided showing how to linearize the robot's deformations when one or more forces are applied to it.**


## Information and requirements

**This code requires "Matlab R2023a", or a more recent version, as well as the installation of the "Optimization Toolbox". There are two main folders associated with the different kinds of robots: "Concentric_Tubes_Robots" and "Tendon_Actuated_Robots". The organisation of the folders is identical to what will be described for a given ROBOT = CTCR or TACR.**

## Content

	- "Äú main.m " is the main script using standard Matlab code.
	- "Ä úmain_cpp.m " is similar to "main.m" but contains MEX functions running converted C++ code using the Matlab Coder app.
	- " ROBOT_CPP/ " ontains the MEX functions.



## Folder contents :

- **"CTCR_CPP" : Contains the MEX functions.**

- "CTCR_Config" : Contains several configuration files examples that can be used to test the code.**
	- "Demo_11"  : CTCR n¬∞1 composed of 2 tubes
	- "Demo_12"  : CTCR n¬∞1 with a tip external force
	- "Demo_13"  : CTCR n¬∞1 with a mid-length external force
	- "Demo_21"  : CTCR n¬∞2 composed of 3 tubes
	- "Demo_22"  : CTCR n¬∞2 with a tip external force
	- "Demo_23"  : CTCR n¬∞2 with a mid-length external force
	- "Demo_24"  : CTCR n¬∞2 with a tip external force and a mid-length distributed external force
	- "Demo_25"  : CTCR n¬∞2 with a tip external force and two mid-length distributed external forces
	- "Demo_26"  : CTCR n¬∞2 with a 1-force deformation linearization
	- "Demo_27"  : CTCR n¬∞2 with a 2-forces deformation linearization
	- "Demo_mex" : CTCR composed of T tubes used to generate the MEX functions

## How to use your custom configuration file : 
1. Open "CTCR_Shape_Functions/Write_Config.m"
2. Change the parameters you want
3. Set the folder "Generalized-Compliance-Computation-for-Continuum-Robots" as the Matlab workspace
4. Run "Write_Config(<your_config_name>)" in the Matlab terminal
5. Change the line n¬∞42 of the "main.m" (or "main_cpp.m") as "name = '<your_config_name>'" ;
6. Run "main.m" (or "main_cpp.m")
