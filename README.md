# Generalized-Compliance-Computation-for-Continuum-Robots

## This code is associated to the following paper. Please cite this reference if reusing the code :

> Guillaume Lods, Benoît Rosa, Bernard Bayle and Florent Nageotte (2024): “Exact Derivative Propagation Method to compute the Generalized Compliance Matrix for Continuum Robots: Application to Concentric Tubes Continuum Robots”. Mechanism and Machine Theory, to appear.

**This code computes the Quasistatic Model, the Generalized Compliance Matrix and the Joint Jacobian of a concentric tubes continuum robot. An example is also provided showing how to linearize the robot's deformations when one or more forces are applied to it.**

**We are currently preparing C++ compilations of the Matlab functions via the Matlab Coder application, as well as MEX functions to reduce the computation time of the models.**

**Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.**
